          <p>
          Back in 2018, I received my Bachelor's degree in Psychology from University of California, Santa Barbara. A year later I decided to 
          do a 180Â° and get into software. I finished General Assembly's Software Engineer Immersive bootcamp in February of 2020. There, I learned 
          how to code with JavaScript, Python, and SQL, along with some databases, like MySQL and MongoDB, and computer science theory.
          I'm now doing online school to learn how to code with Java and C++ ðŸ¤“, everyone's favorite languages!

          Outside of school, my primary focus these days is building products for clients and working on personal projects. But most importantly
          I am actively looking for work. HIRE ME!

          or baking. [insert photos of dogs, rocks, running, and my baked goods]
